Other resources should already be available to use

When running NaiveBayes.ipynb, ensure yelp_labelled.txt is in the same directory or the file won't be read.

The NaiveBayes notebook should be able to be run straight through with no additional work involved, outputs will appear below the selected cell.
The LogisticRegression notebook should also be able to run straight through with no additional work. Outputs will appear below the selected cell. 

Another option is to run NaiveBayes.py in Terminal with:
	python NaiveBayes.py

The output of NaiveBayes.py will be as follows:
	Accuracy %
	Probability Distribution of test data
	Positive word cloud
	Negative word cloud
	Actual rating distribution
	Classified rating distribution
	Confusion matrix
	Most frequent words
	Most informative features
